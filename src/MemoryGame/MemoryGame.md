- 36 cards on a 6x6 grid, placed **randomly** on the grid
- Clicking a card should 'reveal' it - showing the hidden number of the card
- Clicking a second card should reveal that card
- If the second card has the same number as the first card, both cards should be removed from the board after 3 seconds
- If the second card has a different number to the first card, both cards should be 'hidden' again after 3 seconds (i.e. turned face down)
- Click the 3rd card should flip over the prev 2 wrong cards, or remove the prev matching 2 cards.
- Once all cards are removed from the board, the game is over and the 'Play again' button should be shown
- Clicking 'Play again' should generate a new, random set of cards on the grid
