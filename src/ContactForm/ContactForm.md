## Requirements

**THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE DONE IN GFE SITE AS THE API IS NOT ACCESSIBLE FROM LOCALHOST - https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/contact-form?format=user-interface**  
The form should contain the following elements:

- Fields: Name, Email, Message.
- Submit button: Contains the text "Send".
- The form and submission should be implemented mostly in HTML.
- There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.
- Upon submission, POST the form data to <https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/questions/contact-form> with the following fields in the request body: `name`, `email`, `message`.

## Starter Code

```jsx
export default function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input />
    </form>
  )
}
```
