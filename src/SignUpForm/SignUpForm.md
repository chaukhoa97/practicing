## Elements

- Username field: Minimum of 4 characters, Alphanumeric only.
- Email field: Valid email format. A reasonable validation will suffice, you don't have to strictly follow any specification.
- Password field: Minimum of 6 characters.
- Confirm password field: Must match the password field.
- Submit button: Contains the text "Sign Up".

You are free to decide when (during typing/after blur/upon submission) and how (native HTML validation or custom validation) to validate the form. If the validation fails, show the relevant errors near (beside or below) the corresponding `<input>` fields.
