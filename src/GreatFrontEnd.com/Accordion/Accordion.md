## Requirements

- By default, all sections are collapsed and are hidden from view.
- Clicking on a section title toggles the contents.
  - If the section is collapsed, the section will be expanded and the contents will be displayed.
  - If the section is expanded, the section will be collapsed and the contents will be hidden.
- The sections are independent of each other.
- [Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/)

## Notes

- You may modify the markup (e.g. adding ids, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc) and use client-side rendering instead.
- You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during interviews).
