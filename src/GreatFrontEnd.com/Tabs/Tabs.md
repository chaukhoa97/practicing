## Requirements

- Clicking on a tab makes it the active tab. Add a visual indication (e.g. using blue text color) for the active tab to differentiate it from the non-active tabs.
- At all times, only one panel's contents should be displayed — the one corresponding to the active tab's.
- Note: You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during interviews).
